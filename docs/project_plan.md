## Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup
- Start Date: [11/20/2023]
- End Date: [11/20/2023]

#### Define Requirements:
Work out brainstorm of every individual.

#### Create Project Plan:
- Creating datasets with JSON. **DONE**
- Creating database with SQL. **DONE**

- Making JSON datasets to SQL for inserting date in database. ~ 1 Dataset done ~

- Filling database with data from JSON. ~ 1 Dataset done ~

- Creating API with JSON datasets and Javascript. ^ API is working, but not done. ^

- Being able to filter data in API. **DONE**

- Being able to add, edit or delete data in API and insert into database. ~ Finding ways to do this. ~

- Connecting API and database to eachother. **Connection Test Been Done, DONE**

#### Set Up Development Environment:
We will be using JSON, SQL, Javascript

### Phase 2: Development
- Start Date: [11/20/2023]
- End Date: [11/23/2023]

#### Implement Core Features:
- **Database Design**: Construct a comprehensive database schema that can accommodate the diverse data types found in the Pokémon world, such as species, moves, abilities, and habitats.
- **API Development**: Develop a RESTful API that provides access to the data stored in your database. Ensure your API supports various operations like fetching, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- **Security and Scalability**: Implement security best practices to protect the data and ensure that your API can handle a significant number of requests without performance degradation.

#### Continuous Integration and Testing:
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up a continuous integration pipeline that automatically builds and tests your API whenever you push new code to your repository.

#### Iterative Development:
- **Sprint Planning**: Plan and prioritize the features you want to implement each day.
- **Daily Standups**: Hold daily standups to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **Code Reviews**: Review each other's code and provide constructive feedback.
